Search for Pokemon by name or by color. If you want to find information about certain Pokemon, insert its name in the search box (please use lowercase letters in order to get results). 
After you press enter, you get the picture and information about the certain Pokemon. 
Otherwise, if you want to find all Pokemons by certain color, enter the color in the search box (again, use lowercase letters) and you get the list of all Pokemons of that color.
If you are searching for nonexistent Pokemon, you will get the blank page.
